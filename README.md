# Quantitative & Environmental Data Analysis (R)

This repository contains a selection of R Markdown (.Rmd) scripts demonstrating my experience with quantitative analysis, environmental data processing, and reproducible research workflows.

The scripts were developed as part of university coursework and are provided in R Markdown format to integrate code, figures, and scientific interpretation in a transparent and reproducible way.

## Contents

- **Fisheries analysis**
  - Quantitative exploration of fisheries-related datasets, including data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of trends relevant to resource management.

- **Surface and atmospheric temperature calculations**
  - Calculation of surface and atmospheric temperatures using emissivity and albedo constants, with a focus on radiative processes relevant to climate and ocean–atmosphere interactions.

- **Climate variability and biogeochemical relationships**
  - Analysis examining correlations between soil nitrogen content, Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) phases, and sugarcane production, highlighting climate–ecosystem linkages and statistical interpretation.

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- R and R Markdown
- Data wrangling and visualization
- Statistical analysis and correlation testing
- Reproducible research practices
- Scientific interpretation of environmental datasets

These examples are intended to showcase my analytical approach and quantitative skill set rather than serve as finalized publications.
