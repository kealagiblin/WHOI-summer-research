# Quantitative & Environmental Data Analysis (R)

This repository contains a selection of R Markdown (.Rmd) scripts demonstrating my experience with quantitative analysis, environmental data processing, and reproducible research workflows.

The scripts were developed as part of university coursework and are provided in R Markdown format to integrate code, figures, and scientific interpretation in a transparent and reproducible way.

# Contents

# fisheries_analysis.Rmd
Quantitative analysis of fisheries-related data examining trends in catch and effort. This project demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation in a marine resource management context.

# surface_temperature_emissivity.Rmd
A physics-based analysis calculating surface and atmospheric temperatures using emissivity and albedo constants. This project reflects my interest in climate processes relevant to ocean–atmosphere interactions.

# oni_soilN_sugarcane.Rmd
Statistical analysis exploring the relationship between soil nitrogen content, ENSO phases (ONI), and sugarcane production. This project demonstrates correlation analysis, climate indices, and ecological inference.

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- R and R Markdown
- Data wrangling and visualization
- Statistical analysis and correlation testing
- Reproducible research practices
- Scientific interpretation of environmental datasets

These examples are intended to showcase my analytical approach and quantitative skill set rather than serve as finalized publications.
